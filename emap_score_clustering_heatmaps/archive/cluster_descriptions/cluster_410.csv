87,AGP2,YBR132C,Plasma membrane regulator of polyamine and carnitine transport; has similarity to transporters but lacks transport activity; may act as a sensor that transduces environmental signals; has a positive or negative regulatory effect on transcription of many transporter genes,high-Affinity Glutamine Permease,AGP2,410
249,IPT1,YDR072C,"Inositolphosphotransferase; involved in synthesis of mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide (M(IP)2C), the most abundant sphingolipid; can mutate to resistance to the antifungals syringomycin E and DmAMP1 and to K. lactis zymocin",InositolPhosphoTransferase,IPT1,410
1370,MMS1,YPR164W,"Subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in replication repair; stabilizes protein components of the replication fork such as the fork-pausing complex and leading strand polymerase, preventing fork collapse and promoting efficient recovery during replication stress; regulates Ty1 transposition; involved with Rtt101p in nonfunctional rRNA decay",Methyl MethaneSulfonate sensitivity,MMS1,410
