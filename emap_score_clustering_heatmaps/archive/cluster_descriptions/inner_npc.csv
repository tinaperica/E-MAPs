43,NUP170,YBL079W,"Subunit of inner ring of nuclear pore complex (NPC); contributes to NPC assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport; interacts with genomic regions that contain ribosomal protein and subtelomeric genes, where it functions in nucleosome positioning and as a repressor of transcription; both Nup170p and NUP157p are similar to human Nup155p; NUP170 has a paralog, NUP157, that arose from the whole genome duplication",NUclear Pore,NUP170,685
852,POM34,YLR018C,"Subunit of the transmembrane ring of the nuclear pore complex (NPC); contributes to nucleocytoplasmic transport, NPC biogenesis and spindle pole body duplication",POre Membrane,POM34,685
940,NUP188,YML103C,Subunit of the inner ring of the nuclear pore complex (NPC); contributes to NPC organization and nucleocytoplasmic transport; homologous to human NUP188,NUclear Pore,NUP188,685
