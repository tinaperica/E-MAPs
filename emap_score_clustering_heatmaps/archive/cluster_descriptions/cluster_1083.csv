9,LTE1,YAL024C,Protein similar to GDP/GTP exchange factors; without detectable GEF activity; required for asymmetric localization of Bfa1p at daughter-directed spindle pole bodies and for mitotic exit at low temperatures,Low Temperature Essential,LTE1,1083
75,PBY1,YBR094W,Putative tubulin tyrosine ligase associated with P-bodies; may have a role in mRNA metabolism; yeast knockout collection strain identified as a pby1 null mutant is actually wild-type for PBY1 and deleted for mms4,P-BodY associated protein,PBY1,1083
334,MUS81,YDR386W,"Subunit of structure-specific Mms4p-Mus81p endonuclease; cleaves branched DNA; involved in DNA repair, replication fork stability, and joint molecule formation/resolution during meiotic recombination; promotes template switching during break-induced replication (BIR), causing non-reciprocal translocations (NRTs); helix-hairpin-helix protein; phosphorylation of non-catalytic subunit Mms4p by Cdc28p and Cdcp during mitotic cell cycle activates function of Mms4p-Mus81p",MMS and UV Sensitive,MUS81,1083
1109,CLA4,YNL298W,"Cdc42p-activated signal transducing kinase; member of the PAK (p21-activated kinase) family, along with Ste20p and Skm1p; involved in septin ring assembly, vacuole inheritance, cytokinesis, sterol uptake regulation; phosphorylates Cdc3p and Cdc10p; CLA4 has a paralog, SKM1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",CLn Activity dependant,CLA4,1083
