155,PET18,YCR020C,Protein of unknown function; has weak similarity to proteins involved in thiamin metabolism; expression is induced in the absence of thiamin,PETite colonies,PET18,425
567,DIE2,YGR227W,"Dolichyl-phosphoglucose-dependent alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase; located in the ER; functions in pathway that synthesizes the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor for N-linked protein glycosylation; has a role in regulation of ITR1 and INO1; human homolog ALG10B can complement yeast die2 null mutant",Derepression of ITR1 Expression,DIE2,425
711,RPB4,YJL140W,"RNA polymerase II subunit B32; forms dissociable heterodimer with Rpb7p; Rpb4/7 dissociates from RNAPII as Ser2 CTD phosphorylation increases; Rpb4/7 regulates cellular lifespan via mRNA decay process; involved in recruitment of 3'-end processing factors to transcribing RNAPII complex, export of mRNA to cytoplasm under stress conditions; also involved in translation initiation",RNA Polymerase B,RPB4,425
797,ASH1,YKL185W,"Component of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex; zinc-finger inhibitor of HO transcription; mRNA is localized and translated in the distal tip of anaphase cells, resulting in accumulation of Ash1p in daughter cell nuclei and inhibition of HO expression; potential Cdc28p substrate",Asymmetric Synthesis of HO,ASH1,425
1024,AEP2,YMR282C,Mitochondrial protein; likely involved in translation of the mitochondrial OLI1 mRNA; exhibits genetic interaction with the OLI1 mRNA 5'-untranslated leader,ATPase ExPression,AEP2,425
1160,HST1,YOL068C,"NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase; essential subunit of the Sum1p/Rfm1p/Hst1p complex required for ORC-dependent silencing and meiotic repression; non-essential subunit of the Set3C deacetylase complex; involved in telomere maintenance; HST1 has a paralog, SIR2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Homolog of SIR Two (SIR2),HST1,425
1342,NTO1,YPR031W,Subunit of the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex; this complex acetylates histone H3; contains PHD finger domain that interacts with methylated histone H3,NuA Three Orf,NTO1,425
