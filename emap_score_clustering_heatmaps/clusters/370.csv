GSG1,YDR108W,"Component of transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex III; TRAPPIII is a multimeric guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for the GTPase Ypt1p, regulating endosome-Golgi traffic and required for membrane expansion during autophagy and the CVT pathway; directs Ypt1p to the PAS; late post-replication meiotic role",TRapp Subunit
IRS4,YKR019C,"EH domain-containing protein; involved in regulating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels and autophagy; Irs4p and Tax4p bind and activate the PtdIns phosphatase Inp51p; Irs4p and Tax4p are involved in localizing Atg17p to the PAS; IRS4 has a paralog, TAX4, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Increased rDNA Silencing
SPT2,YER161C,Protein involved in negative regulation of transcription; required for RNA polyadenylation; exhibits regulated interactions with both histones and SWI-SNF components; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia; similar to mammalian HMG1 proteins,SuPpressor of Ty's
