DPB3,YBR278W,"Third-largest subunit of DNA polymerase II (DNA polymerase epsilon); required to maintain fidelity of chromosomal replication and also for inheritance of telomeric silencing; stabilizes the interaction of Pol epsilon with primer-template DNA, positively affecting the processivity of the polymerase and exonuclease activities of Pol epsilon; mRNA abundance peaks at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle; DPB3 has a paralog, DLS1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",DNA Polymerase B (II) subunit
DPB4,YDR121W,"Subunit of DNA pol epsilon and of ISW2 chromatin accessibility complex; involved in both chromosomal DNA replication and inheritance of telomeric silencing; stabilizes the interaction of Pol epsilon with primer-template DNA, positively affecting the processivity of the polymerase and exonuclease activities of Pol epsilon; interacts with extranucleosomal DNA and acts as anchor point for ISW2 complex that retains its position on DNA during nucleosome mobilization",DNA Polymerase B (II) subunit
HRT1,YOL133W,"RING-H2 domain core subunit of multiple ubiquitin ligase complexes; subunit of Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) that tethers the Cdc34p (E2) and Cdc53p (cullin) SCF subunits, and is required for degradation of Gic2p, Far1p, Sic1p and Cln2p; subunit of the Rtt101p-Mms1p-Mms22p ubiquitin ligase that stabilizes replication forks after DNA lesions; subunit of the Cul3p-Elc1p-Ela1p ubiquitin ligase involved in Rpb1p degradation as part of transcription-coupled repair",High level expression Reduces Ty3 transposition
