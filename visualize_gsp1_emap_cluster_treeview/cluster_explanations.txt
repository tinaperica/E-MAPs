0325_2

NBP2: Protein involved in the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway; negatively regulates Hog1p by recruitment of phosphatase Ptc1p to the Pbs2p-Hog1p complex
PTC1: Type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C); dephosphorylates Hog1p, inactivating osmosensing MAPK cascade; 






membrane integrity

LAS21: 
Integral plasma membrane protein; involved in the synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) core structure; mutations affect cell wall integrity

RER1:
Protein involved in retention of membrane proteins; including Sec12p, in the ER; localized to Golgi; functions as a retrieval receptor in returning membrane proteins to the ER

ANY1:
Protein involved in phospholipid flippase function; null allele suppresses growth and membrane trafficking defects associated with all flippase null alleles; proposed function as a phospholipid scramblase that reduces membrane asymmetry; PQ loop family member; localizes to the endosome and trans-Golgi network; non-essential gene
