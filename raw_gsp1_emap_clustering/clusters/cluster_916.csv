127,SSH1,YBR283C,Subunit of the Ssh1 translocon complex; Sec61p homolog involved in co-translational pathway of protein translocation; not essential,Sec Sixty-one Homolog,916
723,UBP12,YJL197W,Ubiquitin-specific protease; cleaves ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins; present in the nucleus and cytoplasm,UBiquitin-specific Protease,916
901,YAP1,YML007W,"Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor; required for oxidative stress tolerance; activated by H2O2 through the multistep formation of disulfide bonds and transit from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; Yap1p is degraded in the nucleus after the oxidative stress has passed; mediates resistance to cadmium; relative distribution to the nucleus increases upon DNA replication stress; YAP1 has a paralog, CAD1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Yeast AP-1,916
964,FAR3,YMR052W,"Protein of unknown function; involved in recovery from cell cycle arrest in response to pheromone, in a Far1p-independent pathway; interacts with Far7p, Far8p, Far9p, Far10p, and Far11p; localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress",Factor ARrest,916
