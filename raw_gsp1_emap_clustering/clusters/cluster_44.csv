95,ARL1,YBR164C,"Soluble GTPase with a role in regulation of membrane traffic; regulates potassium influx; role in membrane organization at trans-Golgi network; required for delivery of Atg9p to the phagophore assembly site during autophagy under high temperature stress; required with Ypt6p for starvation-induced autophagy; required for the CVT pathway under non-starvation conditions; G protein of the Ras superfamily, similar to ADP-ribosylation factor",ADP-Ribosylation factor-Like,44
678,SYS1,YJL004C,Integral membrane protein of the Golgi; required for targeting of the Arf-like GTPase Arl3p to the Golgi; multicopy suppressor of ypt6 null mutation,Suppressor of Ypt Six,44
1254,SNU66,YOR308C,Component of the U4/U6.U5 snRNP complex; involved in pre-mRNA splicing via spliceosome; also required for pre-5S rRNA processing and may act in concert with Rnh70p; has homology to human SART-1,Small NUclear ribonucleoprotein associated,44
1280,ARL3,YPL051W,"ARF-like small GTPase of the RAS superfamily; required for recruitment of Arl1p, a GTPase that regulates membrane traffic, to the Golgi apparatus; NatC-catalyzed N-terminal acetylation regulates Golgi membrane association mediated by interaction with membrane receptor, Sys1p; similar to ADP-ribosylation factor and orthologous to mammalian ARFRP1",ADP-Ribosylation factor-Like,44
