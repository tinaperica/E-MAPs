21,BUD14,YAR014C,"Protein involved in bud-site selection; Bud14p-Glc7p complex is a cortical regulator of dynein; forms a complex with Kel1p and Kel2p that regulates Bnr1p (formin) to affect actin cable assembly, cytokinesis, and polarized growth; diploid mutants display a random budding pattern instead of the wild-type bipolar pattern; relative distribution to the nucleus increases upon DNA replication stress",BUD site selection,466
22,KIN3,YAR018C,Nonessential serine/threonine protein kinase; possible role in DNA damage response; influences tolerance to high levels of ethanol,protein KINase,466
961,SUB1,YMR039C,"Transcriptional regulator; facilitates elongation through factors that modify RNAP II; role in peroxide resistance involving Rad2p; role in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) of ds breaks in plasmid DNA, but not chromosomal DNA; role in the hyperosmotic stress response through polymerase recruitment at RNAP II and RNAP III genes; negatively regulates sporulation; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress; functionally complemented by human SUB1 (PC4)",SUppressor of TFIIB mutations,466
972,MOT3,YMR070W,"Transcriptional repressor, activator; role in cellular adjustment to osmotic stress including modulation of mating efficiency; involved in repression of subset of hypoxic genes by Rox1p, repression of several DAN/TIR genes during aerobic growth, ergosterol biosynthetic genes in response to hyperosmotic stress; contributes to recruitment of Tup1p-Cyc8p general repressor to promoters; relocalizes to cytosol under hypoxia; forms [MOT3+] prion under anaerobic conditions",Modifier of Transcription,466
1018,SCS7,YMR272C,"Sphingolipid alpha-hydroxylase; functions in the alpha-hydroxylation of sphingolipid-associated very long chain fatty acids, has both cytochrome b5-like and hydroxylase/desaturase domains, not essential for growth",Suppressor of Ca2+ Sensitivity,466
1048,MSG5,YNL053W,Dual-specificity protein phosphatase; maintains low levels of both basal and induced cell integrity pathway signaling by dephosphorylation of the Slt2p MAPK; reciprocally regulated by Slt2p through phosphorylation; minor role with Ptp2p in the adaptive response to pheromone through the dephosphorylation of the Fus3p MAPK with major contribution by Ptp3p; inhibits the nuclear accumulation of Fus3p; two isoforms exist as the result of alternative translation initiation starts,Multicopy Suppressor of GPA1,466
