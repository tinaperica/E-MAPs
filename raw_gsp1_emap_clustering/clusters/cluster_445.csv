84,PTC4,YBR125C,Cytoplasmic type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C); identified as a high-copy number suppressor of cnb1 mpk1 synthetic lethality; overexpression decreases high-osmolarity induced Hog1p phosphorylation and kinase activity,Phosphatase Two C,445
492,HUL5,YGL141W,"Multiubiquitin chain assembly factor (E4); proteasome processivity factor that elongates polyUb chains on substrates, opposing Ubp6p, a branched polyubiquitin protease; required for retrograde transport of misfolded proteins during ERAD; required for ubiquitination of a subset of cytosolic misfolded proteins upon heat shock",Hect Ubiquitin Ligase,445
577,LAG1,YHL003C,"Ceramide synthase component; involved in synthesis of ceramide from C26(acyl)-coenzyme A and dihydrosphingosine or phytosphingosine, functionally equivalent to Lac1p; forms ER foci upon DNA replication stress; homolog of human CERS2, a tumor metastasis suppressor gene whose silencing enhances invasion/metastasis of prostate cancer cells; LAG1 has a paralog, LAC1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Longevity Assurance Gene,445
675,YAP5,YIR018W,"Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) iron-sensing transcription factor; involved in diauxic shift; YAP5 has a paralog, YAP7, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Yeast AP-1,445
