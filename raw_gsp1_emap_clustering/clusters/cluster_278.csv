276,SAC3,YDR159W,mRNA export factor; required for biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit; component of TREX-2 complex (Sac3p-Thp1p-Sus1p-Cdc31p) involved in transcription elongation and mRNA export from the nucleus; involved in post-transcriptional tethering of active genes to the nuclear periphery and to non-nascent mRNP; similar to the human germinal center-associated nuclear protein (GANP),Suppressor of ACtin,278
326,SEM1,YDR363W-A,"19S proteasome regulatory particle lid subcomplex component; role in Ub-dependent proteolysis and proteasome stability; involved in TREX-2 mediated mRNA export, and in the prevention of transcription-associated genome instability; ubiquitinated by Nedd4-like E3-ligase, Rsp5p; human ortholog DSS1, a BRCA1 binding protein implicated in cancer, complements the yeast null; drives trinucleotide repeat expansion; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress",Suppressor of Exocyst Mutations,278
622,THP2,YHR167W,"Subunit of the THO and TREX complexes; THO connects transcription elongation and mitotic recombination, and TREX is recruited to activated genes and couples transcription to mRNA export; involved in telomere maintenance",THO2 - HPR1 Phenotype,278
830,NUP133,YKR082W,"Subunit of Nup84p subcomplex of nuclear pore complex (NPC); contributes to nucleocytoplasmic transport, NPC biogenesis; is involved in establishment of a normal nucleocytoplasmic concentration gradient of GTPase Gsp1p; also plays roles in several processes that may require localization of genes or chromosomes at nuclear periphery, including double-strand break repair, transcription and chromatin silencing; relocalizes to cytosol in response to hypoxia; homolog of human NUP133",NUclear Pore,278
