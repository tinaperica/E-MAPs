272,NUM1,YDR150W,Protein required for nuclear migration; component of the mitochondria-ER-cortex-ancor (MECA); required for the association of mitochondria with the cell cortex and for accurate distribution of mitochondrial network; interacts with Mdm36p to link the ER and mitochondria at the cortex; localizes to the mother cell cortex and the bud tip; may mediate interactions of dynein and cytoplasmic microtubules with the cell cortex,NUclear Migration,508
362,PAC11,YDR488C,"Dynein intermediate chain, microtubule motor protein; required for intracellular transport and cell division; acts in cytoplasmic dynein pathway; forms complex with dynein light chain Dyn2p that promotes Dyn1p homodimerization and potentiates motor processivity; Dyn2p-Pac11p complex is also important for interaction of dynein motor complex with dynactin complex; forms cortical cytoplasmic microtubule capture site with Num1p; essential in the absence of CIN8",Perish in the Absence of CIN8,508
612,ARP1,YHR129C,Actin-related protein of the dynactin complex; required for spindle orientation and nuclear migration; forms actin-like short filament composed of 9 or 10 Arp1p monomers; putative ortholog of mammalian centractin,Actin-Related Protein,508
849,LDB18,YLL049W,Component of the dynactin complex; dynactin is required for dynein activity; null mutant exhibits defects in nuclear migration and spindle orientation and has reduced affinity for alcian blue dye; has homology to mammalian dynactin subunit p24,Low Dye Binding,508
1029,JNM1,YMR294W,"Component of the yeast dynactin complex; consisting of Nip100p, Jnm1p, and Arp1p; required for proper nuclear migration and spindle partitioning during mitotic anaphase B",Just Nuclear Migration,508
1030,DYN3,YMR299C,"Dynein light intermediate chain (LIC); localizes with dynein, null mutant is defective in nuclear migration",DYNein,508
1312,NIP100,YPL174C,Large subunit of the dynactin complex; dynactin is involved in partitioning the mitotic spindle between mother and daughter cells; putative ortholog of mammalian p150(glued),Nuclear ImPort,508
