206,IWR1,YDL115C,"RNA polymerase II transport factor, conserved from yeast to humans; also has a role in transporting RNA polymerase III into the nucleus; interacts with most of the RNAP II subunits; nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein; deletion causes hypersensitivity to K1 killer toxin; protein increases in abundance and relocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasm upon DNA replication stress",Interacts With RNA polymerase II,511
582,RIM101,YHL027W,Cys2His2 zinc-finger transcriptional repressor; involved in alkaline responsive gene repression as part of adaptation to alkaline conditions; involved in cell wall assembly; required for alkaline pH-stimulated haploid invasive growth and sporulation; activated by alkaline-dependent proteolytic processing which results in removal of the C-terminal tail; similar to A. nidulans PacC,Regulator of IME2,511
1107,RIM21,YNL294C,"pH sensor molecule, component of the RIM101 pathway; has a role in cell wall construction and alkaline pH response; is glycosylated and phosphorylated; interacts with Dfg16p and Rim9p to form a pH-sensing complex; localization to the plasma membrane is dependent on Dfg16p and Rim9p; has similarity to A. nidulans PalH",Regulator of IME2,511
1245,RIM20,YOR275C,Protein involved in proteolytic activation of Rim101p; part of response to alkaline pH; PalA/AIP1/Alix family member; interaction with the ESCRT-III subunit Snf7p suggests a relationship between pH response and multivesicular body formation,Regulator of IME2,511
1251,CPA1,YOR303W,"Small subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase; carbamoyl phosphate synthetase catalyzes a step in the synthesis of citrulline, an arginine precursor; translationally regulated by an attenuator peptide encoded by YOR302W within the CPA1 mRNA 5'-leader",Carbamyl Phosphate synthetase A,511
