73,POL30,YBR088C,Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); functions as the sliding replication clamp for DNA polymerase delta; may function as a docking site for other proteins required for mitotic and meiotic chromosomal DNA replication and for DNA repair; PCNA ubiquitination at K164 plays a crucial role during Okazaki fragment processing,POLymerase,375
817,GMH1,YKR030W,Golgi membrane protein of unknown function; interacts with Gea1p and Gea2p; required for localization of Gea2p; computational analysis suggests a possible role in either cell wall synthesis or protein-vacuolar targeting; conserved from yeast to human,Gea1-6 Membrane-associated High-copy suppressor,375
1347,MAK3,YPR051W,"Catalytic subunit of the NatC type N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT); involved in subcellular targeting of select N-terminally acetylated substrates to the Golgi apparatus (Arl3p and Grh1p) and the inner nuclear membrane (Trm1p); required for replication of dsRNA virus; human NatC ortholog, Naa60, functionally complements the null, requiring either auxiliary subunit Mak10p or co-expression of human ortholog, Naa35; Naa60, the human NatF gene, also complements the null allele",MAintenance of Killer,375
