348,PPM1,YDR435C,"Carboxyl methyltransferase; methylates the C terminus of the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (Pph21p or Pph22p), which is important for complex formation with regulatory subunits; required for methionine to inhibit autophagy and promote growth",Protein Phosphatase Methyltransferase,72
778,MUD2,YKL074C,"Protein involved in early pre-mRNA splicing; component of the pre-mRNA-U1 snRNP complex, the commitment complex; interacts with Msl5p/BBP splicing factor and Sub2p; similar to metazoan splicing factor U2AF65",Mutant U1 Die,72
1304,RRD2,YPL152W,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase; also activates the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); regulates G1 phase progression, the osmoresponse, microtubule dynamics; subunit of the Tap42p-Pph21p-Rrd2p complex; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress",Resistant to Rapamycin Deletion,72
