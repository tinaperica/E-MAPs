439,BUD27,YFL023W,"Unconventional prefoldin protein involved in translation initiation; required for correct assembly of RNAP I, II, and III in an Rpb5p-dependent manner; shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm; mutants have inappropriate expression of nutrient sensitive genes due to translational derepression of Gcn4p transcription factor; diploid mutants show random budding; ortholog of human URI/RMP",BUD site selection,1056
473,RAD6,YGL058W,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2); involved in postreplication repair as a heterodimer with Rad18p, regulation of K63 polyubiquitination in response to oxidative stress, DSBR and checkpoint control as a heterodimer with Bre1p, ubiquitin-mediated N-end rule protein degradation as a heterodimer with Ubr1p, ERAD with Ubr1p in the absence of canonical ER membrane ligases, and Rpn4p turnover as part of proteasome homeostasis, in complex with Ubr2p and Mub1p",RADiation sensitive,1056
1307,AIM44,YPL158C,Protein that regulates Cdc42p and Rho1p; functions in the late steps of cytokinesis and cell separation; sustains Rho1p at the cell division site after actomyosin ring contraction; inhibits the activation of Cdc42-Cla4 at the cell division site to prevent budding inside the old bud neck; transcription is regulated by Swi5p; null mutant displays elevated frequency of mitochondrial genome loss; relocalizes from bud neck to cytoplasm upon DNA replication stress,Altered Inheritance rate of Mitochondria,1056
