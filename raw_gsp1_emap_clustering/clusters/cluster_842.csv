186,SLC1,YDL052C,"1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid, a key intermediate in lipid metabolism; enzymatic activity detected in lipid particles and microsomes",SphingoLipid Compensation,842
190,PEX19,YDL065C,Chaperone and import receptor for newly-synthesized class I PMPs; binds peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) in the cytoplasm and delivers them to the peroxisome for subsequent insertion into the peroxisomal membrane; interacts with Myo2p and contributes to peroxisome partitioning,PEroXisome related,842
319,PEX3,YDR329C,Peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP); required for proper localization and stability of PMPs; anchors peroxisome retention factor Inp1p at the peroxisomal membrane; interacts with Pex19p,PEroXin,842
495,PEX14,YGL153W,Central component of the peroxisomal importomer complex; peroxisomal protein import machinery docking complex component; interacts with both PTS1 (Pex5p) and PTS2 (Pex7p) peroxisomal matrix protein signal recognition factors and membrane receptor Pex13p,PEroXisome related,842
754,ENT3,YJR125C,Protein containing an N-terminal epsin-like domain; involved in clathrin recruitment and traffic between the Golgi and endosomes; associates with the clathrin adaptor Gga2p,Epsin N-Terminal homology,842
762,BYE1,YKL005C,"Negative regulator of transcription elongation; contains a TFIIS-like domain that associates with chromatin and a PHD domain that interacts with H3K4me3; multicopy suppressor of temperature-sensitive ess1 mutations, binds RNA polymerase II large subunit",BYpass of ESS1,842
799,PEX1,YKL197C,AAA-peroxin; heterodimerizes with AAA-peroxin Pex6p and participates in the recycling of peroxisomal signal receptor Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane to the cystosol; induced by oleic acid and upregulated during anaerobiosis; mutations in human PEX1 can lead to severe peroxisomal disorders and early death,PEroXin,842
869,IOC2,YLR095C,Subunit of the Isw1b complex; exhibits nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity and acts within coding regions to coordinate transcription elongation with termination and processing; contains a PHD finger motif; other complex members are Isw1p and Ioc4p,Iswi One Complex,842
956,PEX12,YMR026C,C3HC4-type RING-finger peroxin and E3 ubiquitin ligase; required for peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisomal matrix protein import; forms translocation subcomplex with Pex2p and Pex10p; mutations in human homolog cause peroxisomal disorder,PEroXin,842
1032,GAS1,YMR307W,"Beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase; required for cell wall assembly and also has a role in transcriptional silencing; localizes to cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor; also found at nuclear periphery; genetic interactions with histone H3 lysine acetyltransferases GCN5 and SAS3 indicate previously unsuspected functions for Gas1 in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation",Glycophospholipid-Anchored Surface protein,842
1119,PEX6,YNL329C,AAA-peroxin; heterodimerizes with AAA-peroxin Pex1p and participates in the recycling of peroxisomal signal receptor Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane to the cystosol; mutations in human PEX6 can lead to severe peroxisomal disorders and early death,PEroXin,842
