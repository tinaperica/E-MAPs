78,SIF2,YBR103W,WD40 repeat-containing subunit of Set3C histone deacetylase complex; complex represses early/middle sporulation genes; antagonizes telomeric silencing; binds specifically to the Sir4p N-terminus,Sir4p-Interacting Factor,96
502,HOS2,YGL194C,"Histone deacetylase and subunit of Set3 and Rpd3L complexes; required for gene activation via specific deacetylation of lysines in H3 and H4 histone tails; subunit of the Set3 complex, a meiotic-specific repressor of sporulation specific genes that contains deacetylase activity; co-localizes with Cmr1p in nuclear foci in response to DNA damage by MMS",Hda One Similar,96
816,SET3,YKR029C,"Defining member of the SET3 histone deacetylase complex; which is a meiosis-specific repressor of sporulation genes; necessary for efficient transcription by RNAPII; one of two yeast proteins that contains both SET and PHD domains; SET3 has a paralog, SET4, that arose from the whole genome duplication",SET domain-containing,96
