159,RIM1,YCR028C-A,ssDNA-binding protein essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance; involved in mitochondrial DNA replication; stimulates utilization by Mip1p DNA polymerase of RNA primers synthesized by Rpo41p,Replication In Mitochondria,915
169,IMG2,YCR071C,"Mitochondrial ribosomal protein of the large subunit; conserved in metazoa, with similarity to human mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL49",Integrity of Mitochondrial Genome,915
218,CRD1,YDL142C,"Cardiolipin synthase; produces cardiolipin, which is a phospholipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane that is required for normal mitochondrial membrane potential and function and for correct integration of membrane-multispanning proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane; required to maintain tubular mitochondrial morphology and functions in mitochondrial fusion; also required for normal vacuolar ion homeostasis",CaRDiolipin synthase,915
312,SUM1,YDR310C,"Transcriptional repressor that regulates middle-sporulation genes; required for mitotic repression of middle sporulation-specific genes; also acts as general replication initiation factor; involved in telomere maintenance, chromatin silencing; regulated by pachytene checkpoint",SUppresor of Mar1-1,915
446,RPO41,YFL036W,"Mitochondrial RNA polymerase; single subunit enzyme similar to those of T3 and T7 bacteriophages; requires a specificity subunit encoded by MTF1 for promoter recognition; Mtf1p interacts with and stabilizes the Rpo41p-promoter complex, enhancing DNA bending and melting to facilitate pre-initiation open complex formation; Rpo41p also synthesizes RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication",RNA POlymerase,915
802,LOS1,YKL205W,"Nuclear pore protein; involved in nuclear export of pre-tRNA and in re-export of mature tRNAs after their retrograde import from the cytoplasm; deletion mutation extends replicative lifespan, as does exclusion of Los1p from the nucleus in response to caloric restriction",Loss Of Suppression,915
1146,MDM38,YOL027C,Membrane-associated mitochondrial ribosome receptor; forms a complex with Mba1p to facilitate recruitment of mRNA-specific translational activators to ribosomes; ribosome-associated protein involved in the insertion of newly synthesized proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane; role in protein export and K+/H+ exchange; localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane; human ortholog Letm1 implicated in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome,Mitochondrial Distribution and Morphology,915
1152,GSH2,YOL049W,Glutathione synthetase; catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutathione (GSH) from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine; induced by oxidative stress and heat shock,Glutathione,915
1221,PET123,YOR158W,"Mitochondrial ribosomal protein of the small subunit; PET123 exhibits genetic interactions with PET122, which encodes a COX3 mRNA-specific translational activator",PETite colonies,915
1255,DGK1,YOR311C,Diacylglycerol kinase; localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); overproduction induces enlargement of ER-like membrane structures and suppresses a temperature-sensitive sly1 mutation; contains a CTP transferase domain,DiacylGlycerol Kinase,915
1260,MIP1,YOR330C,"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma; single subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase in yeast, in contrast to metazoan complex of catalytic and accessory subunits; polymorphic in yeast, petites occur more frequently in some lab strains; human ortholog POLG complements yeast mip1 mutant; mutations in human POLG associated with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), parkinsonism, other mitochondrial diseases",MItochondrial DNA Polymerase,915
