259,BMH2,YDR099W,"14-3-3 protein, minor isoform; controls proteome at post-transcriptional level, binds proteins and DNA, involved in regulation of many processes including exocytosis, vesicle transport, Ras/MAPK signaling, and rapamycin-sensitive signaling; protein increases in abundance and relative distribution to the nucleus increases upon DNA replication stress; abundance relative to Bmh1p increases during sporulation",Brain Modulosignalin Homolog,850
1181,STI1,YOR027W,"Hsp90 cochaperone; regulates spatial organization of amyloid-like proteins in the cytosol, thereby buffering the proteotoxicity caused by amyloid-like proteins; interacts with the Ssa group of the cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones and activates Ssa1p ATPase activity; interacts with Hsp90 chaperones and inhibits their ATPase activity; homolog of mammalian Hop",STress Inducible,850
1369,URN1,YPR152C,Protein of unknown function containing WW and FF domains; overexpression causes accumulation of cells in G1 phase,"U2-U5-U6 snRNP, RES complex, and NTC interacting protein",850
