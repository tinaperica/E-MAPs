3,SWC3,YAL011W,"Protein of unknown function; component of the SWR1 complex, which exchanges histone variant H2AZ (Htz1p) for chromatin-bound histone H2A; required for formation of nuclear-associated array of smooth endoplasmic reticulum known as karmellae",SWr Complex,487
322,SWR1,YDR334W,"Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase; structural component of the SWR1 complex, which exchanges histone variant H2AZ (Htz1p) for chromatin-bound histone H2A; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia; chronological aging factor that mediates lifespan extension by dietary restriction",SWi2/snf2-Related,487
361,VPS72,YDR485C,Htz1p-binding component of the SWR1 complex; exchanges histone variant H2AZ (Htz1p) for chromatin-bound histone H2A; may function as a lock that prevents removal of H2AZ from nucleosomes; required for vacuolar protein sorting,Vacuolar Protein Sorting,487
865,ARP6,YLR085C,"Actin-related protein that binds nucleosomes; a component of the SWR1 complex, which exchanges histone variant H2AZ (Htz1p) for chromatin-bound histone H2A",Actin-Related Protein,487
916,VPS71,YML041C,Nucleosome-binding component of the SWR1 complex; SWR1 exchanges histone variant H2AZ (Htz1p) for chromatin-bound histone H2A; required for vacuolar protein sorting,Vacuolar Protein Sorting,487
1141,HTZ1,YOL012C,Histone variant H2AZ; exchanged for histone H2A in nucleosomes by the SWR1 complex; involved in transcriptional regulation through prevention of the spread of silent heterochromatin; Htz1p-containing nucleosomes facilitate RNA Pol II passage by affecting correct assembly and modification status of RNA Pol II elongation complexes and by favoring efficient nucleosome remodeling,Histone Two A Z1,487
