162,RBK1,YCR036W,Putative ribokinase,RiBoKinase,849
174,FIG2,YCR089W,"Cell wall adhesin, expressed specifically during mating; may be involved in maintenance of cell wall integrity during mating; FIG2 has a paralog, AGA1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Factor-Induced Gene,849
287,HST4,YDR191W,"NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase; deacetylation targets are primarily mitochondrial proteins; involved along with Hst3p in silencing at telomeres, cell cycle progression, radiation resistance, genomic stability and short-chain fatty acid metabolism; accumulates in mitochondria in response to biotin starvation and may link biotin metabolism with energy homeostasis; member of the Sir2 family and may be the functional equivalent of human SIRT3",Homolog of SIR Two (SIR2),849
561,PCT1,YGR202C,"Cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase; a rate-determining enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, inhibited by Sec14p, activated upon lipid-binding; contains an element within the regulatory domain involved in both silencing and activation of enzymatic activity",Phosphocholine CytidylylTransferase,849
734,HUL4,YJR036C,Protein with similarity to hect domain E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases; not essential for viability; found in association with Trf4 in TRAMP complex,Hect Ubiquitin Ligase,849
1028,GOT1,YMR292W,Homodimeric protein that is packaged into COPII vesicles; cycles between the ER and Golgi; involved in secretory transport but not directly required for aspects of transport assayed in vitro; may influence membrane composition,GOlgi Transport,849
1324,LEA1,YPL213W,Component of U2 snRNP complex; disruption causes reduced U2 snRNP levels; physically interacts with Msl1p; putative homolog of human U2A' snRNP protein,Looks Exceptionally like U2A,849
