283,NGG1,YDR176W,"Subunit of chromatin modifying histone acetyltransferase complexes; member of the ADA complex, the SAGA complex, and the SLIK complex; transcriptional regulator involved in glucose repression of Gal4p-regulated genes",,1057
352,ADA2,YDR448W,Transcription coactivator; component of the ADA and SAGA transcriptional adaptor/HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complexes,transcriptional ADAptor,1057
570,GCN5,YGR252W,"Catalytic subunit of ADA and SAGA histone acetyltransferase complexes; modifies N-terminal lysines on histones H2B and H3; acetylates Rsc4p, a subunit of the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex, altering replication stress tolerance; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia; mutant displays reduced transcription elongation in the G-less-based run-on (GLRO) assay; greater involvement in repression of RNAPII-dependent transcription than in activation",General Control Nonderepressible,1057
