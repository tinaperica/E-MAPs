706,PBS2,YJL128C,MAP kinase kinase of the HOG signaling pathway; activated under severe osmotic stress; mitophagy-specific regulator; plays a role in regulating Ty1 transposition,Polymyxin B Sensitivity,PBS2,1137
850,SSK1,YLR006C,Cytoplasmic phosphorelay intermediate osmosensor and regulator; part of a two-component signal transducer that mediates osmosensing via a phosphorelay mechanism; required for mitophagy; dephosphorylated form is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; potential Cdc28p substrate,Suppressor of Sensor Kinase,SSK1,1137
874,HOG1,YLR113W,Mitogen-activated protein kinase involved in osmoregulation; controls global reallocation of RNAPII during osmotic shock; mediates recruitment/activation of RNAPII at Hot1p-dependent promoters; binds calmodulin; stimulates antisense transcription to activate CDC28; defines novel S-phase checkpoint with Mrc1p that prevent replication/transcription conflicts; nuclear form represses pseudohyphal growth; autophosphorylates; protein abundance increases under DNA replication stress,High Osmolarity Glycerol response,HOG1,1137
913,SRC1,YML034W,"Inner nuclear membrane protein; highly enriched at telomeres and subtelomeric regions; functions in regulation of subtelomeric genes and is linked to TREX (transcription export) factors; SRC1 produces 2 splice variant proteins with different functions; alternative splicing of SRC1 pre-mRNA is promoted by Hub1p; mutant has aneuploidy tolerance; SEC1 has a paralog, HEH2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Spliced mRNA and Cell cycle regulated gene,SRC1,1137
1126,SSK2,YNR031C,"MAP kinase kinase kinase of HOG1 mitogen-activated signaling pathway; interacts with Ssk1p, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of Ssk2p which phosphorylates Pbs2p; also mediates actin cytoskeleton recovery from osmotic stress; a HOG-independent function of Ssk2p mediates the calcium-sensitive phenotype of the ptp2 msg5 double disruptant; SSK2 has a paralog, SSK22, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Suppressor of Sensor Kinase,SSK2,1137
