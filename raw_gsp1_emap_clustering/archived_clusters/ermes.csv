14,GEM1,YAL048C,"Outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, subunit of the ERMES complex; potential regulatory subunit of the ERMES complex that links the ER to mitochondria and may promote inter-organellar calcium and phospholipid exchange as well as coordinating mitochondrial DNA replication and growth; cells lacking Gem1p contain collapsed, globular, or grape-like mitochondria; ortholog of metazoan Miro GTPases",GTPase EF-hand protein of Mitochondria,GEM1,378
511,MDM34,YGL219C,Mitochondrial component of the ERMES complex; links the ER to mitochondria and may promote inter-organellar calcium and phospholipid exchange as well as coordinating mitochondrial DNA replication and growth; required for mitophagy; ERMES complex is often co-localized with peroxisomes and with concentrated areas of pyruvate dehydrogenase,Mitochondrial Distribution and Morphology,MDM34,378
1002,PFK2,YMR205C,"Beta subunit of heterooctameric phosphofructokinase; involved in glycolysis; indispensable for anaerobic growth; activated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and AMP; mutation inhibits glucose induction of cell cycle-related genes",PhosphoFructoKinase,PFK2,378
1139,MDM12,YOL009C,"Mitochondrial outer membrane protein, ERMES complex subunit; required for transmission of mitochondria to daughter cells; required for mitophagy; may influence import and assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins; ERMES complex is often co-localized with peroxisomes and with concentrated areas of pyruvate dehydrogenase",Mitochondrial Distribution and Morphology,MDM12,378
