# NOTE This script assumes any averaging for EMAP data and SGA data has already been done.

##### Pseudo-code for SGA preprocessing #####
#  - Pre-process EMAP and SGA data: choose reference EMAP dataset, do any averaging you want
#     - "First, in order to have a single measurement for each SGA interaction, we average
#       all interactions where multiple measurements were available (eg query geneA x array 
#       geneB and query geneB array geneA). For interactions with only a single measurement
#       available, a pseudo-averaging was performed, following...Collins et al 2006"
#     - Maybe don't need to do this, write the code for it anyway, and try both.
#  - Scale the average SGA scores to make them comparable with the reference E-MAP data:
#     - Take pairs interactions in both SGA and EMAP reference
#     - Order each subset from lowest to highest
#     - Split into 500 bins for each subset
#         - 2nd bin has 50% overlap with first and third, and so on
#     - Compare mean of each SGA bin to mean of EMAP bin, computing scaling factor as the
#       ratio mu_EMAP/mu_SGA
#     - Fit a univariate spline to the function scaling factor = f(SGA score)
#         - Do not use SGA scores close to zero to fit this curve
#     - A scaling factor for each SGA score in the entire data subset can be caluclated using
#       this fitted curve
#   - Compare the QQ plots from before and after scaling. In Ryan et al 2012, the scaled
#     SGA data was nearly identical to the EMAP data in the range of -10 to 5. Points outside
#     of this range correspond to less than 0.1% of the data.
#   - This method requires assuming that (1) there exists an identical number of "true"
#     genetic interactions shared between the two datasets, and (2) that the rank ordering of
#     both methods is of similar quality. Ryan et al 2012 asserts (1) is trivially true and
#     showed (2) by using EMAP and SGA scores to predict biologically known synthetic lethal
#     interactions from BIOGRID.
#   - Comparison of EMAP datasets suggests that they're highly correlated but not identical.

##### Prepare the EMAP Reference Dataset #####
# We need to remove the duplicate measurements for the slp dataset The slp dataset was square, with
#   repeat measurements for each value, so that the score for pair (Q,A) is also recorded for pair (A,Q).
# This can be shown by ordering the perturbations in a pair in a standard way (alphabetically) and then
#   grouping by the standard ordering (Pert1, Pert2). To confirm each group contains exactly two
#   duplicates, call:
#     group_by(Pert1, Pert2) %>% mutate(n=n(), sd = sd(score)) %>% summary()
# There are 869,676 observations in the slp dataset, and 434,838 observations after removing duplicates.
#   To confirm that no two double perturbation strains are repeated in this cleaned dataset, call:
#   group_by(Query_strain, Array_strain) %>% filter(n() > 1)

# Duplicate measurements: There are duplicate measurements for some double perturbations at two

#  significant SGA observations that overlap with our reference cF3 dataset (.14%). These are
#  not enough to warrant concern for skewing the scaling, especially given that these are
#  biologically distinct replicates, just as two different mutants at the same temperature would be.
