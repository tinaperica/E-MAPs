Steps:

  1. Pick subset of queries to be "landmark queries"
  2. Compute similarity metric (pearson? cosine? try both) between each query and all landmark queries
  3. threshold using a minimum similarity as well as a quantile for top similarities
  4. Edge lengths proportional to similarity (also significance? i.e. num of points or pvalue), using force-directed algorithm
  5. Build graph, coloring landmarks differently than other queries
  6. Calculate similarity between queries using graph metrics (neighborhoods, shortest distance, etc)
  7. Visualize clusters
