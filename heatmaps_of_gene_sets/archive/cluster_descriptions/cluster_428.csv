2,MDM10,YAL010C,"Subunit of both the ERMES and the SAM complex; component of ERMES complex which acts as a molecular tether between the mitochondria and the ER, necessary for efficient phospholipid exchange between organelles and for mitophagy; SAM/TOB complex component that functions in the assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins; involved in mitochondrial inheritance and morphology; ERMES complex is often co-localized with peroxisomes and concentrated areas of pyruvate dehydrogenase",Mitochondrial Distribution and Morphology,MDM10,428
710,YUR1,YJL139C,"Mannosyltransferase involved in protein N-glycosylation; member of the KTR1 family; located in the Golgi apparatus; YUR1 has a paralog, KTR2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Yeast Unknown Reading frame,YUR1,428
740,CBF1,YJR060W,"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein; forms homodimer to bind E-box consensus sequence CACGTG present at MET gene promoters and centromere DNA element I (CDEI); affects nucleosome positioning at this motif; associates with other transcription factors such as Met4p and Isw1p to mediate transcriptional activation or repression; associates with kinetochore proteins, required for chromosome segregation; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress",Centromere Binding Factor,CBF1,428
920,GAL80,YML051W,Transcriptional regulator involved in the repression of GAL genes; involved in the repression of GAL genes in the absence of galactose; inhibits transcriptional activation by Gal4p; inhibition relieved by Gal3p or Gal1p binding,GALactose metabolism,GAL80,428
925,RPS1B,YML063W,"Ribosomal protein of the small (40S) subunit; homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein S3A, no bacterial homolog; RPS1B has a paralog, RPS1A, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Ribosomal Protein of the Small subunit,RPS1B,428
932,UFO1,YML088W,"F-box receptor protein; subunit of the Skp1-Cdc53-F-box receptor (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex; binds to phosphorylated Ho endonuclease, allowing its ubiquitination by SCF and subsequent degradation",UV-F-box-HO,UFO1,428
997,SGS1,YMR190C,"RecQ family nucleolar DNA helicase; role in genome integrity maintenance, chromosome synapsis, meiotic joint molecule/crossover formation; stimulates activity of Top3p; rapidly lost in response to rapamycin in Rrd1p-dependent manner; forms nuclear foci upon DNA replication stress; yeast SGS1 complements mutations in human homolog BLM implicated in Bloom syndrome; also similar to human WRN implicated in Werner syndrome; human BLM and WRN can each complement yeast null mutant",Slow Growth Suppressor,SGS1,428
1021,BUL1,YMR275C,"Ubiquitin-binding component of the Rsp5p E3-ubiquitin ligase complex; disruption causes temperature-sensitive growth, overexpression causes missorting of amino acid permeases; BUL1 has a paralog, BUL2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Binds Ubiquitin Ligase,BUL1,428
1027,NGL2,YMR285C,"Protein involved in 5.8S rRNA processing; Ccr4p-like RNase required for correct 3'-end formation of 5.8S rRNA at site E; similar to Ngl1p; NGL2 has a paralog, NGL3, that arose from the whole genome duplication",,NGL2,428
1173,ALG6,YOR002W,"Alpha 1,3 glucosyltransferase; involved in transfer of oligosaccharides from dolichyl pyrophosphate to asparagine residues of proteins during N-linked protein glycosylation; C998T transition in human ortholog ALG6 causes carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type-Ic; wild-type human ortholog ALG6 can partially complement yeast alg6 mutant",Asparagine-Linked Glycosylation,ALG6,428
