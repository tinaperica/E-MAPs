163,PER1,YCR044C,Protein of the endoplasmic reticulum; required for GPI-phospholipase A2 activity that remodels the GPI anchor as a prerequisite for association of GPI-anchored proteins with lipid rafts; functionally complemented by human ortholog PERLD1,protein Processing in the ER,PER1,377
1005,ESC1,YMR219W,Protein involved in telomeric silencing; required for quiescent cell telomere hypercluster localization at nuclear membrane vicinity; interacts with PAD4-domain of Sir4p,Establishes Silent Chromatin,ESC1,377
1155,PRS5,YOL061W,"5-phospho-ribosyl-1(alpha)-pyrophosphate synthetase; synthesizes PRPP, which is required for nucleotide, histidine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; one of five related enzymes, which are active as heteromultimeric complexes; forms cytoplasmic foci upon DNA replication stress",PhosphoRibosylpyrophosphate Synthetase,PRS5,377
1216,SFL1,YOR140W,"Transcriptional repressor and activator; involved in repression of flocculation-related genes, and activation of stress responsive genes; has direct role in INO1 transcriptional memory; negatively regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A subunit Tpk2p; premature stop codon (C1430T, Q477-stop) in SK1 background is linked to the aggressively invasive phenotype of SK1 relative to BY4741 (S288C)",Suppressor gene for FLocculation,SFL1,377
