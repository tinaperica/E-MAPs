POM152,YMR129W,"Glycoprotein subunit of transmembrane ring of nuclear pore complex; contributes to nucleocytoplasmic transport, nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis and spindle pole body duplication; homologous to human NUP210",POre Membrane
SWP82,YFL049W,Member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex; has an as yet unidentified role in the complex; has identifiable counterparts in closely related yeast species; abundantly expressed in many growth conditions; paralog of Npl6p; relocates to the cytosol under hypoxic conditions,SWi/snf-associated Protein
TOF2,YKR010C,"Protein required for rDNA silencing and mitotic rDNA condensation; stimulates Cdc14p phosphatase activity and biphasic release to promote rDNA repeat segregation; required for condensin recruitment to the replication fork barrier site; TOF2 has a paralog, NET1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",TOpoisomerase I-interacting Factor
TPS2,YDR074W,Phosphatase subunit of the trehalose-6-P synthase/phosphatase complex; involved in synthesis of the storage carbohydrate trehalose; expression is induced by stress conditions and repressed by the Ras-cAMP pathway; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress,Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthase/phosphatase
