NCS2,YNL119W,Protein required for uridine thiolation of Lys(UUU) and Glu(UUC) tRNAs; required for the thiolation of uridine at the wobble position of Lys(UUU) and Glu(UUC) tRNAs; has a role in urmylation and in invasive and pseudohyphal growth; inhibits replication of Brome mosaic virus in S. cerevisiae,Needs Cla4 to Survive
NCS6,YGL211W,"Protein required for uridine thiolation of Gln, Lys, and Glu tRNAs; required for the thiolation of uridine at the wobble position of Gln, Lys, and Glu tRNAs; has a role in urmylation and in invasive and pseudohyphal growth; inhibits replication of Brome mosaic virus in S. cerevisiae",Needs Cla4 to Survive
UBA4,YHR111W,E1-like protein that activates Urm1p before urmylation; also acts in thiolation of the wobble base of cytoplasmic tRNAs by adenylating and then thiolating Urm1p; receives sulfur from Tum1p,UBiquitin-Activating
