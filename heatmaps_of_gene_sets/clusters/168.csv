CKA1,YIL035C,"Alpha catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2); a Ser/Thr protein kinase with roles in cell growth and proliferation; CK2, comprised of CKA1, CKA2, CKB1 and CKB2, has many substrates including transcription factors and all RNA polymerases; regulates Fkh1p-mediated donor preference during mating-type switching",Casein Kinase Alpha subunit
GPB1,YOR371C,"Multistep regulator of cAMP-PKA signaling; inhibits PKA downstream of Gpa2p and Cyr1p, thereby increasing cAMP dependency; promotes ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of Ira2p; regulated by G-alpha protein Gpa2p; GPB1 has a paralog, GPB2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",
UBC13,YDR092W,E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; involved in the error-free DNA postreplication repair pathway; interacts with Mms2p to assemble ubiquitin chains at the Ub Lys-63 residue; DNA damage triggers redistribution from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,UBiquitin-Conjugating
