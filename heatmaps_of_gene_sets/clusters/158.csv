CTF19,YPL018W,"Outer kinetochore protein, needed for accurate chromosome segregation; component of kinetochore sub-complex COMA (Ctf19p, Okp1p, Mcm21p, Ame1p) that functions as platform for kinetochore assembly; required for spindle assembly checkpoint; minimizes potentially deleterious centromere-proximal crossovers by preventing meiotic DNA break formation proximal to centromere; homolog of human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-P and fission yeast fta2",Chromosome Transmission Fidelity
IML3,YBR107C,Outer kinetochore protein and component of the Ctf19 complex; involved in the establishment of pericentromeric cohesion during mitosis; prevents non-disjunction of sister chromatids during meiosis II; forms a stable complex with Chl4p; required for localization of Sgo1p to pericentric sites during meiosis I; orthologous to human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-L and fission yeast fta1,Increased Minichromosome Loss
IRC15,YPL017C,"Microtubule associated protein; regulates microtubule dynamics; required for accurate meiotic chromosome segregation; null mutant displays large budded cells due to delayed mitotic progression, increased levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci; IRC15 has a paralog, LPD1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Increased Recombination Centers
MAD1,YGL086W,Coiled-coil protein involved in spindle-assembly checkpoint; required for inhibition of karyopherin/importin Pse1p (aka Kap121p) upon spindle assembly checkpoint arrest; phosphorylated by Mps1p upon checkpoint activation which leads to inhibition of anaphase promoting complex activity; forms a complex with Mad2p; gene dosage imbalance between MAD1 and MAD2 leads to chromosome instability,Mitotic Arrest-Deficient
MAD2,YJL030W,Component of the spindle-assembly checkpoint complex; delays onset of anaphase in cells with defects in mitotic spindle assembly; forms a complex with Mad1p; regulates APC/C activity during prometaphase and metaphase of meiosis I; gene dosage imbalance between MAD1 and MAD2 leads to chromosome instability,Mitotic Arrest-Deficient
MAD3,YJL013C,"Subunit of spindle-assembly checkpoint complex; involved in delaying anaphase onset in cells with defects in mitotic spindle assembly; pseudosubstrate inhibitor of APC(Cdc20), the anaphase promoting complex involved in securin (Pds1p) turnover; MAD3 has a paralog, BUB1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Mitotic Arrest-Deficient
MCM16,YPR046W,Component of the Ctf19 complex and the COMA subcomplex; involved in kinetochore-microtubule mediated chromosome segregation; binds to centromere DNA; orthologous to human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-H and fission yeast fta3,MiniChromosome Maintenance
MCM21,YDR318W,"Component of the kinetochore sub-complex COMA; COMA (Ctf19p, Okp1p, Mcm21p, Ame1p) bridges kinetochore subunits in contact with centromeric DNA with subunits bound to microtubules during kinetochore assembly; involved in minichromosome maintenance; modified by sumoylation; orthologous to human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-O and fission yeast mal2",MiniChromosome Maintenance
MCM22,YJR135C,Outer kinetochore protein and component of the Ctf3 subcomplex; binds to centromeric DNA in a Ctf19p-dependent manner; involved in chromosome segregation and minichromosome maintenance; orthologous to human centromere constitutive-associated network (CCAN) subunit CENP-K and fission yeast sim4,MiniChromosome Maintenance
NKP1,YDR383C,Central kinetochore protein and subunit of the Ctf19 complex; mutants have elevated rates of chromosome loss; orthologous to fission yeast kinetochore protein fta4,Non-essential Kinetochore Protein
RMI1,YPL024W,"Subunit of the RecQ (Sgs1p) - Topo III (Top3p) complex; stimulates superhelical relaxing, DNA catenation/decatenation and ssDNA binding activities of Top3p; involved in response to DNA damage; functions in S phase-mediated cohesion establishment via a pathway involving the Ctf18-RFC complex and Mrc1p; stimulates Top3p DNA catenation/decatenation activity; null mutants display increased rates of recombination and delayed S phase",RecQ Mediated genome Instability
