name,ORF,description,name_meaning
AKR2,YOR034C,"Ankyrin repeat-containing protein; member of a family of putative palmitoyltransferases containing an Asp-His-His-Cys-cysteine rich (DHHC-CRD) domain; possibly involved in constitutive endocytosis of Ste3p; AKR2 has a paralog, AKR1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",AnKyrin Repeat-containing protein
HST3,YOR025W,"Member of the Sir2 family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases; involved along with Hst4p in telomeric silencing, cell cycle progression, radiation resistance, genomic stability and short-chain fatty acid metabolism",Homolog of SIR Two (SIR2)
SNF1,YDR477W,"AMP-activated S/T protein kinase; complexes with Snf4p and a Sip1p/Sip2p/Gal83p family member; required for glucose-repressed gene transcription, heat shock, sporulation, and peroxisome biogenesis; active form involved in mitotic spindle alignment in non-limiting glucose; regulates Hxk2p nucleocytoplasmic shuttling; regulates filamentous growth and acts as a non-canonical GEF-activating Arf3p during invasive growth; sumoylation inhibits Snf1p, targeting it for Ub-ligase mediated destruction",Sucrose NonFermenting
WHI2,YOR043W,"Negative regulator of TORC1 in response to limiting leucine; suppresses TORC1 activity with binding partners Psr1p/Psr2p, acting in parallel with SEACIT; regulates cell cycle arrest in stationary phase; inhibits Ras-cAMP-PKA regulation of apoptosis during nutrient depletion; required with Psr1p for activation of the general stress response; role in rapamycin-induced mitophagy; localizes to the cell periphery; human tumor suppressor and Whi2-like protein KCTD11 functionally complements the null",WHIskey
