ELP2,YGR200C,Subunit of Elongator complex; binds to microtubules via conserved alkaline residues; has two seven-bladed WD40 &#946; propellers; Elongator complex is required for modification of wobble nucleosides in tRNA; target of Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin,ELongator Protein
ELP3,YPL086C,Subunit of Elongator complex; Elongator is required for modification of wobble nucleosides in tRNA; exhibits histone acetyltransferase activity that is directed to histones H3 and H4; disruption confers resistance to K. lactis zymotoxin; human homolog ELP3 can partially complement yeast elp3 null mutant,ELongator Protein
ELP4,YPL101W,Subunit of hexameric RecA-like ATPase Elp456 Elongator subcomplex; which is required for modification of wobble nucleosides in tRNA; required for Elongator structural integrity; null mutation is functionally complemented by human ELP4,ELongator Protein
ELP6,YMR312W,Subunit of hexameric RecA-like ATPase Elp456 Elongator subcomplex; which is required for modification of wobble nucleosides in tRNA; required for Elongator structural integrity,ELongator Protein
IKI1,YHR187W,Subunit of hexameric RecA-like ATPase Elp456 Elongator subcomplex; which is required for modification of wobble nucleosides in tRNA; iki1 mutations confer resistance to the K. lactis toxin zymocin,Insensitive to KIller toxin
SGF29,YCL010C,"Component of the HAT/Core module of the SAGA, SLIK, and ADA complexes; HAT/Core module also contains Gcn5p, Ngg1p, and Ada2p; binds methylated histone H3K4; involved in transcriptional regulation through SAGA and TBP recruitment to target promoters and H3 acetylation",SaGa associated Factor
