ERV14,YGL054C,"COPII-coated vesicle protein; involved in vesicle formation and incorporation of specific secretory cargo; required for the delivery of bud-site selection protein Axl2p and Nha1p antiporter to cell surface; related to Drosophila cornichon; ERV14 has a paralog, ERV15, that arose from the whole genome duplication",ER Vesicle
IRC21,YMR073C,Protein of unknown function; may be involved in resistance to carboplatin and cisplatin; null mutant displays increase in spontaneous Rad52p foci; contains a lipid-binding domain and binds cardiolipin in a large-scale study,Increased Recombination Centers
SAP185,YJL098W,"Protein that forms a complex with the Sit4p protein phosphatase; required for Sit4p function; member of a family of similar proteins including Sap4p, Sap155p, and Sap190p; SAP185 has a paralog, SAP190, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Sit4 Associated Protein
SIS2,YKR072C,"Negative regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (Ppz1p); involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis; subunit of phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC: Cab3p, Sis2p, Vhs3p) complex and the CoA-Synthesizing Protein Complex (CoA-SPC: Cab2p, Cab3p, Cab4p, Cab5p, Sis2p and Vhs3p); SIS2 has a paralog, VHS3, that arose from the whole genome duplication",SIt4 Suppressor
