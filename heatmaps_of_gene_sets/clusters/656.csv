PEX22,YAL055W,Putative peroxisomal membrane protein; required for import of peroxisomal proteins; functionally complements a Pichia pastoris pex22 mutation,PEroXisome related
UGA1,YGR019W,Gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) transaminase; also known as 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase; involved in the 4-aminobutyrate and glutamate degradation pathways; required for normal oxidative stress tolerance and nitrogen utilization; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress,Utilization of GAba
YCK2,YNL154C,"Palmitoylated plasma membrane-bound casein kinase I (CK1) isoform; shares redundant functions with Yck1p in morphogenesis, proper septin assembly, endocytic trafficking, and glucose sensing; stabilized by Sod1p binding in the presence of glucose and oxygen, causing glucose repression of respiratory metabolism; involved in the phosphorylation and regulation of glucose sensor Rgt2p; YCK2 has a paralog, YCK1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",Yeast Casein Kinase
