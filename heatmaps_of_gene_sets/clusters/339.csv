name,ORF,description,name_meaning
GBP2,YCL011C,"Poly(A+) RNA-binding protein; key surveillance factor for the selective export of spliced mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; preference for intron-containing genes; similar to Npl3p; also binds single-stranded telomeric repeat sequence in vitro; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia; GBP2 has a paralog, HRB1, that arose from the whole genome duplication",G-strand Binding Protein
MUD1,YBR119W,U1 snRNP A protein; homolog of human U1-A; involved in nuclear mRNA splicing,Mutant U1 Die
NOT5,YPR072W,"Component of the CCR4-NOT core complex, involved in mRNA decapping; involved intranscription initiation and elongation and in mRNA degradation; conserved lysine in human homolog of Not5p and Not3p is mutated in cancers",Negative On TATA
RAD18,YCR066W,E3 ubiquitin ligase; forms heterodimer with Rad6p to monoubiquitinate PCNA-K164; heterodimer binds single-stranded DNA and has single-stranded DNA dependent ATPase activity; required for postreplication repair; SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbl) that contains a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) which stimulates its ubiquitin ligase activity towards the sumoylated form of PCNA,RADiation sensitive
SPT23,YKL020C,"ER membrane protein involved in regulation of OLE1 transcription; inactive ER form dimerizes and one subunit is then activated by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent processing followed by nuclear targeting; SPT23 has a paralog, MGA2, that arose from the whole genome duplication",SuPpressor of Ty
YER077C,YER077C,Protein that associates with mitochondrial ribosome; green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion protein localizes to the mitochondrion; null mutation results in a decrease in plasma membrane electron transport,Mitochondrial oRganization of gene eXpression (MIOREX)
