CDC26,YFR036W,"Subunit of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C); which is a ubiquitin-protein ligase required for degradation of anaphase inhibitors, including mitotic cyclins, during the metaphase/anaphase transition; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia",Cell Division Cycle
CHL1,YPL008W,"Probable DNA helicase; involved in sister-chromatid cohesion and genome integrity and interstrand cross-link repair; interacts with ECO1 and CTF18; mutants are defective in silencing, rDNA recombination, aging and the heat shock response; FANCJ-like helicase family member; mutations in the human homolog, DDX11/ChLR1, cause Warsaw breakage syndrome",CHromosome Loss
SWM1,YDR260C,Subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC); APC is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the metaphase-anaphase transition and exit from mitosis; required for activation of the daughter-specific gene expression and spore wall maturation,Spore Wall Maturation
